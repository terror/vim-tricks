## Sorting

- `:sort` to sort lines
- `:sort!` to sort lines in reverse order
- `:sort n` to sort lines numerically
- `:%!sort -u` to sort lines alphabetically, removing duplicate lines

## Digraphs

Digraphs are `special` characters such as the copyright symbol or accent grave.

- `ctrl-K + <two letter combo>` to output a digraph (in insert mode)
- A list of defined digraphs can be found by issuing the `:digraphs` command

## Batch inserting

- `$` to move to the end of the line
- `w` to move to the beginning of the next word
- `e` to move the the end of the next word
- `b` to move to the beginning of the previous word

There are a few commands for aligning text horizontally in vim

- `:left` aligns text to the left
- `:right` aligns text to the right

## Retracing movements

Sometimes it's useful to jump to previously
modified positions in a file.

- `'.` jump to last modified line
- `` `.`` jump to exact spot in last modified line
- `ctrl-O` retrace movements in file backwards (in
  normal mode)
- `ctrl-I` retrace movements in file forwards

### Example

## Deleting/Changing inside X

Programmers often work with parentheses (), brackets []
and curly braces {}. It's often useful to wipe or
modify contents in between them.

- `di{insert key here}` to delete inside
- `ci{insert key here}` to change inside

### Nifty mappings

Remapping the operators can save some time here:

```vim
onoremap b i[
onoremap p i(
onoremap cb i{
```
